# Given an array of n positive integers and a positive integer s, find the
# minimal length of a contiguous subarray of which the sum â‰¥ s. If there
# isn't one, return 0 instead.
# For example, Given Input: s = 7, nums = [2, 3, 1, 2, 4, 3],
# Output will be: 2, Because the subarray [4,3] has the minimal length under
# the problem constraint.
# If you have figured out the O(n) solution, try coding another solution of
# which the time complexity is O(n log n).
