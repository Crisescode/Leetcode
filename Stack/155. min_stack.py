# Given a string containing just the characters '(', ')', '{', '}', '[' and ']', determine if the input string is valid.
# An input string is valid if:
# 1. Open brackets must be closed by the same type of brackets.
# 2. Open brackets must be closed in the correct order.
# Note that an empty string is also considered valid.

# For example, Given Input = "()[{}]", output will be True. Given Input = "([})", Output will be False.
